# Solving-Lane-Emden-Equation-PINNs

- Collaborated on the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Lane-Emden equation, a fundamental differential equation in astrophysics used to model polytropic fluid structures.
- Successfully formulated and executed a methodology for generating training data and assessing model accuracy, achieving an impressive mean squared error (MSE) of 4.41 × 10−10 when compared against analytical solutions.
